# ALX Listing App

This is a listing app built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. The project aims to create an Airbnb-like listing page where users can browse and interact with property listings.

## Project Overview

The ALX Listing App is designed to showcase modern web development practices using Next.js for server-side rendering and client-side navigation, along with Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable styling. The application provides a clean, user-friendly interface for browsing property listings with features similar to popular accommodation booking platforms.

- **constants/**: Stores application-wide constants, configuration values, and data that doesn't change frequently.

- **public/assets/**: Contains static files like images, icons, and other media that are publicly accessible.
